# Reproducibility report

The jupyter notebook files in this folder reproduces the experiments in the paper. Specifically,
- `realdata-visualizations.ipynb`: Produces dual visualization from our CKDR method.
- `realdata-predictions.ipynb`: Prediction performance comparison with competing methods for compositional data (their codes are in `./other_methods` folder)
- `simulation-subsp-convergence.ipynb`: Simulation experiments on the central compositional subspace convergence
- `simulation-predictions.ipynb`: Simulation experiments on the predictive model performances

Other `.py` files are helper files for simulations and predictions, which should not be removed.
